# FHE Library Verification Architecture

## Core Objective
**Verify the correct operation of Sunscreen.tech's FHE library** using zkVM proofs to ensure FHE computations are mathematically sound and tamper-free.

## Problem Statement
- **Trust Issue**: How do we know Sunscreen FHE performed homomorphic operations correctly?
- **Verification Gap**: FHE libraries are complex black boxes - need cryptographic audit trail
- **Integrity Requirement**: Election results depend on FHE correctness, must be provable

## Architecture Design

### Two-Layer Verification System

```rust
// Layer 1: Sunscreen FHE Computation (External, Untrusted)
fn sunscreen_fhe_voting() -> SunscreenResults {
    let encrypted_votes = voters.map(|vote| sunscreen.encrypt(vote, election_pk));
    let encrypted_tallies = sunscreen.homomorphic_add_all(encrypted_votes);
    let final_results = sunscreen.decrypt(encrypted_tallies, election_sk);
    
    SunscreenResults {
        inputs: encrypted_votes,
        outputs: encrypted_tallies, 
        final_tallies: final_results,
        claimed_operations: "homomorphic addition of encrypted votes"
    }
}

// Layer 2: zkVM FHE Verification (Trustless Audit)
fn zkvm_fhe_audit(sunscreen_results: SunscreenResults) -> FheVerificationProof {
    // Re-implement identical FHE operations using reference implementation
    let reference_runtime = PureRustFheRuntime::new();
    
    // Verify each step of Sunscreen's computation
    let mut audit_log = Vec::new();
    
    // 1. Verify encryption correctness
    for (vote, ciphertext) in zip(votes, sunscreen_results.inputs) {
        let expected_cipher = reference_runtime.encrypt(vote, election_pk);
        verify_encryption_equivalence(ciphertext, expected_cipher)?;
        audit_log.push("Encryption: VERIFIED");
    }
    
    // 2. Verify homomorphic addition correctness  
    let expected_tallies = reference_runtime.homomorphic_add_all(sunscreen_results.inputs);
    verify_homomorphic_equivalence(sunscreen_results.outputs, expected_tallies)?;
    audit_log.push("Homomorphic Addition: VERIFIED");
    
    // 3. Verify decryption correctness
    let expected_results = reference_runtime.decrypt(expected_tallies, election_sk);
    assert_eq!(sunscreen_results.final_tallies, expected_results);
    audit_log.push("Decryption: VERIFIED");
    
    // Generate cryptographic proof of verification
    FheVerificationProof {
        sunscreen_input_hash: hash(sunscreen_results.inputs),
        sunscreen_output_hash: hash(sunscreen_results.outputs),
        reference_output_hash: hash(expected_tallies),
        verification_status: "SUNSCREEN FHE OPERATIONS MATHEMATICALLY CORRECT",
        audit_trail: audit_log,
        fhe_spec_compliance: "BFV scheme parameters and operations verified"
    }
}
```

### Verification Process Flow

```
Phase 1: FHE Computation (Sunscreen)
├── Input: Encrypted votes under shared election key
├── Process: Sunscreen homomorphic addition operations
├── Output: Encrypted tallies + decrypted final results
└── Claim: "FHE operations performed correctly"

Phase 2: FHE Verification (zkVM)
├── Input: Sunscreen's inputs, outputs, and operations
├── Process: Re-execute same FHE operations with reference implementation
├── Verification: Compare Sunscreen results vs reference implementation
└── Output: Cryptographic proof of FHE correctness

Phase 3: On-Chain Settlement
├── Smart contract receives FHE verification proof
├── Contract verifies zkVM proof cryptographically
├── If verified: Accept election results as mathematically sound
└── If failed: Reject results, FHE computation was incorrect
```

## Technical Verification Components

### 1. Encryption Verification
```rust
fn verify_encryption_correctness(
    plaintext: Signed,
    ciphertext: SunscreenCiphertext,
    public_key: &PublicKey
) -> bool {
    // Verify ciphertext structure matches BFV specification
    // Verify noise level is within expected bounds
    // Verify polynomial coefficients are properly formed
    // Compare against reference implementation
}
```

### 2. Homomorphic Operation Verification  
```rust
fn verify_homomorphic_addition(
    input_ciphers: &[SunscreenCiphertext],
    output_cipher: &SunscreenCiphertext,
    public_key: &PublicKey
) -> bool {
    // Re-execute homomorphic addition with reference implementation
    let expected_result = reference_homomorphic_add(input_ciphers);
    
    // Verify polynomial coefficient arithmetic
    // Verify noise growth follows theoretical bounds
    // Verify modular reduction correctness
    // Compare final ciphertext structure
    
    cryptographic_equivalence(output_cipher, &expected_result)
}
```

### 3. Decryption Verification
```rust
fn verify_decryption_correctness(
    ciphertext: &SunscreenCiphertext,
    plaintext: Signed,
    private_key: &PrivateKey
) -> bool {
    // Verify BFV decryption algorithm steps
    // Verify noise removal and scaling
    // Verify final plaintext extraction
    // Compare against reference implementation
    
    let expected_plaintext = reference_decrypt(ciphertext, private_key);
    plaintext == expected_plaintext
}
```

## Security Properties

### What This Proves
✅ **FHE Mathematical Correctness**: Sunscreen follows BFV specification exactly  
✅ **No Computation Tampering**: Results provably came from declared operations  
✅ **Parameter Compliance**: All FHE parameters within security bounds  
✅ **Reproducible Execution**: Same inputs always produce same outputs  
✅ **Library Integrity**: Sunscreen implementation matches academic standards  

### What This Doesn't Prove
❌ **Individual vote privacy**: That's handled by FHE cryptography itself  
❌ **Key generation security**: Separate concern from operation verification  
❌ **Network security**: Transport layer security is separate  
❌ **Voter authentication**: Identity verification is separate system
