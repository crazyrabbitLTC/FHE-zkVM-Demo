## Critical Security Issues Identified

### 1. **CRITICAL: Undersized RLWE Parameters**
- **Current**: n = 32 (≈20-25 bits security)
- **Required**: n ≥ 2048 (preferably 4096) for 128-bit security
- **Impact**: Practical lattice attacks can recover secret key in minutes
- **Priority**: IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### 2. **CRITICAL: Multi-Key Inconsistency**
- **Issue**: Claims "individual FHE keys per voter" but implements single-key BFV
- **Problem**: Cannot add ciphertexts encrypted under different keys
- **Solutions**: 
  - Use single election key with voters encrypting under shared public key
  - Implement true multi-key BFV with key-switching
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 3. **Malformed Ciphertext Vulnerabilities**
- **Issue**: Missing bounds checking in addition operations
- **Impact**: Coefficient overflow → wraparound → tally corruption
- **Fix**: Add proper modular reduction in all arithmetic paths

### 4. **Side-Channel Exposure**
- **Issue**: Private key visible in zkVM execution trace
- **Solution**: Use `risc0-zkvm::secret_mem` to seal sensitive data
- **Impact**: Malicious prover can extract private key

## Production Hardening Requirements

### Immediate Security Fixes
1. **Upgrade to production FHE parameters** (n=4096, q≈2^218)
2. **Resolve multi-key architecture** decision
3. **Implement proper secret sealing** in zkVM
4. **Add relinearization keys** for deeper circuits
5. **Implement CCA-secure ciphertext** wrapping

3. **Constant-time polynomial arithmetic**
4. **Memory-DoS protection** with input size limits
5. **Formal noise budget tracking**

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Hybrid architecture**: External FHE + in-VM verification
2. **SIMD ballot batching** to amortize proof overhead
3. **Parallelized polynomial operations**
4. **GPU acceleration** for NTT operations

- **Memory exhaustion** through large polynomial DoS

### Medium Severity
- **Ballot omission** attacks (incomplete input sets)
- **Double-voting** without uniqueness checks
- **Prover denial-of-service** by refusing to publish receipts

## Conclusion

The project represents a **significant research breakthrough** in combining FHE privacy with zkVM verifiability. While not production-ready due to security parameter choices and architectural inconsistencies, it successfully demonstrates the feasibility and opens new possibilities for trustless privacy-preserving computation.

**Recommendation**: Continue development with focus on addressing the critical security issues identified, particularly parameter upgrades and multi-key architecture resolution.
