# O3 Multi-Key Architecture Review

**Date**: 2025-06-14  
**Reviewer**: OpenAI O3  
**Topic**: Multi-Key FHE Architecture Decision  

## Executive Decision

**Recommendation: Option A – Single Election Key**

### Key Rationale
- **Cryptographically simpler** and immediately correct
- **Fits current zkVM resource envelope** 
- **Fastest path to production**
- **All production FHE voting systems** use this approach (Helios-FHE, Inferno, etc.)

---

## Technical Analysis

### Option A: Single Election Key ✅ RECOMMENDED

#### Advantages
✅ **Correctness**: Trivial, ciphertexts add/multiply natively  
✅ **Simpler proof logic**: zkVM only proves "I performed FHE ops with pk_election"  
✅ **Performance**: No key-switching, constant per ballot cost  
✅ **Well studied**: Battle-tested in production systems  

#### Trade-offs
⚠️ **Trust assumption**: Whoever reconstructs sk_election can decrypt every vote  
⚠️ **Insider threat**: Malicious tally authority could store and decrypt later  

#### Mitigations Required
- **Threshold secret sharing** among ≥t trustees (t = n/2 + 1)
- **DKG with publicly verifiable transcripts**
- **Publish H(pk_election‖params) on-chain** before voting
- **Ephemeral key lifecycle** with public destruction ceremony

### Option B: True Multi-Key ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED

#### Why Not Viable
❌ **Memory explosion**: 90GB+ evaluation keys for 1000 voters  
❌ **Performance**: 15-25× slower than baseline  
❌ **Implementation risk**: Multi-key BFV not battle-hardened  
❌ **zkVM constraints**: Doesn't fit RISC0 memory limits  

#### Implementation Complexity Matrix
| Metric | Option A | Option B |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Code delta** | <500 LOC | >3000 LOC |
| **zkVM RAM** | +1 MB | +100 MB+ |
| **Cycle cost** | 1× baseline | 15-25× |
| **Crypto risk** | Well studied | Not audited |

## Security Best Practices for Option A

### 1. Key Ceremony
```
1. Run Verifiable Distributed Key Generation (VDKG) among m trustees
2. Each trustee outputs share s_i; joint pk_election is deterministic
3. Publish transcript hash and pk_election to immutable log/smart-contract
4. All ballots reference pk_id = H(pk_election‖params)
```

### 2. Storage & Management
- **HSM storage** for each share s_i with t-of-m quorum requirement
- **Never reconstruct** full secret outside zkVM
- **Additive secret-sharing** to stream shares into guest memory

### 3. zkVM Handling
```rust
// Load secret shares via secret_mem
let shares = risc0_zkvm::secret_mem::load_threshold_shares();
// Combine inside guest only at final tally
let election_sk = combine_shares(&shares);
// Zeroise immediately after use
risc0_zkvm::zeroize(&election_sk);
```

### 4. Additional Security Measures
- **CCA security**: Wrap BFV in Fujisaki-Okamoto transform
- **Ballot authenticity**: Sign votes with voter credentials outside FHE
- **Replay protection**: Include election-specific domain-separation tags
- **Constant-time operations**: Prevent side-channel attacks in zkVM
- **Parameter selection**: n=16384, q≈2^60 for 128-bit post-quantum security

## Migration Strategy

### Versioned Architecture
```rust
struct Ciphertext {
    version: u8,        // 0 = single-key, 1 = key-switched
    pk_id: u32,         // hash of original public key
    // ... BFV body
}
```

### Incremental Rollout Plan
1. **Phase 0** (now): Option A baseline implementation
2. **Phase 1**: Add per-voter signature + pk_id field support
3. **Phase 2**: Implement proxy re-encryption outside zkVM
4. **Phase 3**: Research memory-efficient MK-CKKS for future upgrade

### Design for Future Migration
- **Cryptographic agility**: Keep FHE scheme behind trait interface
- **Ballot format versioning**: Allow future re-interpretation
- **Proxy re-encryption bridge**: Mix single-key and multi-key approaches

---

## Implementation Priority

### Critical Requirements
1. **Fix mathematical inconsistency** immediately
2. **Implement threshold key generation** with DKG
3. **Add zkVM secret memory protection** for private keys
4. **Create key commitment** and verification system

### Success Metrics
- ✅ All ciphertexts under same election key
- ✅ Threshold security with t-of-m trustee model
- ✅ Performance maintains <60s proof generation
- ✅ Cryptographic parameters meet 128-bit security

## Conclusion

**Adopt Option A with hardened threshold key ceremony immediately.**

This approach:
- **Repairs the mathematical flaw** in current implementation
- **Matches performance constraints** of current zkVM
- **Follows industry best practices** from production systems
- **Provides clear migration path** to advanced multi-key schemes

The recommendation strongly aligns with practical constraints while maintaining cryptographic soundness and security guarantees.
