# Trustless FHE Voting Architecture Proposal

## Problem Statement
Design a fully trustless FHE voting system where:
- ✅ Users encrypt their own votes (individual privacy)
- ✅ Anyone can run the FHE computation (no privileged operators)
- ✅ FHE runs inside zkVM (provable correctness)
- ✅ Final results are public (transparent tallies)
- ✅ No trusted parties required (fully decentralized)

## Proposed Solution: Sealed Private Key Architecture

### Core Concept
Voters provide their FHE private keys in a **sealed format** that only the zkVM can access, enabling trustless decryption during computation while maintaining vote privacy.

### Architecture Design

```rust
// 1. Voter Key Generation (Client-side)
let (voter_pk, voter_sk) = generate_fhe_keypair();

// 2. Vote Encryption (Client-side)
let encrypted_vote = fhe_encrypt(vote_choice, voter_pk);

// 3. Private Key Sealing (Client-side)
let sealed_private_key = risc0_zkvm::seal(voter_sk);

// 4. Ballot Submission
let ballot = VoterBallot {
    voter_id: voter_address,
    encrypted_vote: encrypted_vote,
    sealed_private_key: sealed_private_key,
    voter_signature: sign(encrypted_vote || sealed_private_key),
};

// 5. Trustless Computation (Anyone can run)
fn zkvm_guest_program(ballots: Vec<VoterBallot>) -> PublicTallies {
    let mut tallies = [0u32; NUM_CANDIDATES];
    
    for ballot in ballots {
        // Verify voter signature
        verify_signature(ballot.voter_signature, ballot.voter_id)?;
        
        // Unseal private key inside zkVM (only possible here)
        let voter_sk = risc0_zkvm::unseal(ballot.sealed_private_key)?;
        
        // Decrypt vote inside secure enclave
        let plaintext_vote = fhe_decrypt(ballot.encrypted_vote, voter_sk)?;
        
        // Add to public tally
        tallies[plaintext_vote.candidate_index] += 1;
        
        // Immediately zeroize private key
        risc0_zkvm::zeroize(voter_sk);
    }
    
    // Output public results
    PublicTallies {
        candidate_tallies: tallies,
        total_votes: ballots.len(),
        computation_hash: hash_computation_trace(),
    }
}

// 6. On-chain Verification
contract ElectionVerifier {
    function verifyElectionResults(
        bytes32 computationHash,
        uint256[] memory tallies,
        bytes memory zkProof
    ) external {
        require(risc0Verifier.verify(zkProof, computationHash));
        emit ElectionResults(tallies);
    }
}
```

### Process Flow

```
Phase 1: Vote Casting
├── Voter generates FHE keypair (pk, sk)
├── Voter encrypts vote: Enc(vote, pk)  
├── Voter seals private key: Seal(sk)
└── Voter submits: (encrypted_vote, sealed_sk, signature)

Phase 2: Trustless Computation (Anyone can run)
├── Operator collects all voter ballots
├── Operator runs zkVM computation:
│   ├── Unseals each private key inside zkVM
│   ├── Decrypts each vote inside zkVM
│   ├── Tallies all votes
│   └── Generates cryptographic proof
└── Operator submits results + proof to blockchain

Phase 3: On-chain Verification
├── Smart contract verifies zkVM proof
├── Contract accepts results if proof valid
└── Public tallies are permanently recorded
```

## Security Properties

### Privacy Guarantees
- **Individual vote secrecy**: Votes encrypted with voter's own keys
- **Computation privacy**: Private keys only accessible inside sealed zkVM
- **Forward secrecy**: Private keys zeroized immediately after use
- **No key reuse**: Fresh keypair for each vote/election

### Trustlessness Properties  
- **No privileged operators**: Anyone can run the computation
- **No shared secrets**: Each voter controls their own encryption
- **No trusted setup**: No ceremony or authority required
- **Verifiable computation**: Cryptographic proof of correct tallying

### Integrity Guarantees
- **Ballot authenticity**: Voter signatures prevent ballot stuffing
- **Computation correctness**: zkVM proof ensures proper FHE operations
- **Result immutability**: On-chain storage prevents tampering
- **Audit trail**: Complete cryptographic verification chain

## Technical Considerations

### zkVM Sealing Mechanism
```rust
// Client-side sealing (public operation)
let sealed_data = risc0_zkvm::seal(
    private_key_bytes,
    target_guest_id, // Only this specific zkVM program can unseal
    sealing_policy   // Additional access controls
);

// zkVM unsealing (inside secure enclave only)
let private_key = risc0_zkvm::unseal(sealed_data)
    .expect("Only valid inside target zkVM guest");
```

### Memory Management
- **Secure allocation**: Private keys in protected memory regions
- **Immediate zeroization**: Clear keys after single use
- **Bounds checking**: Prevent buffer overflows in key handling
- **Stack protection**: Prevent key leakage via stack dumps

### Performance Characteristics
- **Linear scaling**: O(n) complexity for n votes
- **Constant memory**: Fixed memory per vote regardless of total count
- **Parallel processing**: Votes can be processed independently
- **Proof size**: Constant proof size regardless of vote count

## Potential Vulnerabilities

### Attack Vectors to Consider
1. **Malicious voter keys**: Invalid or crafted private keys
2. **Seal tampering**: Attempts to modify sealed key data
3. **Replay attacks**: Reusing ballots across elections
4. **DoS attacks**: Submitting malformed or oversized ballots
5. **Side-channel attacks**: Information leakage during decryption
6. **Griefing attacks**: Invalid ballots that break computation

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Key validation**: Verify FHE key correctness before sealing
2. **Seal integrity**: Cryptographic checksums on sealed data
3. **Election binding**: Include election ID in ballot structure
4. **Input validation**: Size limits and format checks
5. **Constant-time ops**: Side-channel resistant decryption
6. **Error handling**: Graceful handling of invalid ballots

## Questions for Expert Review

2. **How does this scale to large elections** (millions of votes)?
3. **Are there better alternatives** to achieve the same trustlessness goals?
4. **What are the operational security requirements** for voters?

### Attack Analysis
